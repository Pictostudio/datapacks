# Datapacks

This repository consists of a bunch of datapack projects that I am I've wanted to create or try and figure out how certain things work.
Some of these will be released and others may not be because they won't work or I won't finish them, though I'm allowing allow access rights to this repo so that anyone can view and read the code to help them understand how to create their own datapacks or use the inspiration.
